    <p  align="justify"><h4>The biochemical reactions occurring on protein after its formation are known as post-translational modifications (PTMs). Lysine formylation is a type of PTM that is mostly viewed on histone proteins of prokaryote and eukaryote. The addition of biochemical formylation unit (-CHO) to a lysine residue through isopeptide bond is known as lysine formylation. It is responsible for playing various essential function in cell mechanism including DNA repair, DNA binding, proteinâ€“protein interactions, and metabolic pathways.</h4></p>
